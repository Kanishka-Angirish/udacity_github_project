### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project focuses on analyzing bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The analysis allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week to gain insights into bikeshare usage patterns. Key findings include the most popular times for bikeshare usage, the most frequently used stations, trip durations, and user demographics.

### Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to gain insights into bikeshare usage patterns in major U.S. cities. By analyzing data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C., the project aims to uncover trends related to peak travel times, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics. These insights can be valuable for city planners, bikeshare companies, and users alike to improve bikeshare services and optimize resource allocation.
